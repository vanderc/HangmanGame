# Overview

I made this program to demonstrate my knowledge of C++. This code is for a hangman game where you can guess a letter that is in a word. 


# Development Environment
- visual studio code
- C++

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I could make it so the word that is used comes from a list and is randomly chosen. 
- I could make it so it repeats so you can play it multiple times.
